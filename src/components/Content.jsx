      <h2>Movie  </h2>
      <h3>Futurama: The Odd Couple</h3>
      <p>Futurama is a classic animated sitcom that follows the adventures of Philip J. Fry, a cryogenically frozen pizza delivery boy who wakes up in the 31st century. Fry teams up with Bender Bending Rodríguez, a foul-mouthed robot, and Leela Turanga, a cyclops security guard, to work for Planet Express, a interplanetary delivery service.

Fry and Bender are an unlikely pair, but they quickly become best friends. Fry is the optimistic and naïve one, while Bender is the cynical and sarcastic one. Despite their differences, they always have each other's backs.
<br /><br />
One of the things that makes Fry and Bender such a great duo is their chemistry. They play off of each other perfectly, and their interactions are always funny and heartwarming. They are the odd couple, but they are perfect for each other.

Futurama is a great show, and Fry and Bender are two of the best characters on television. They are funny, heartwarming, and always entertaining. If you haven't seen Futurama, I highly recommend it. You won't regret it.</p>
